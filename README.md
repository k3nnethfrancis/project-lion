# PROJECT LION

### Project Lion or GPT-lion is a research project aimed at leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3 API to learn the language of organizational networks and perform various NLP tasks using GPT-3 over more common open source NLP packages [e.g., Gensim, NLTK, SpaCy, etc.].

### L.I.O.N is an acronym for language informatics on organizational networks.

We believe that GPT-3 is a powerful language model that has far greater applications than chatbots or code generation. Specifically, in the field of psychology and linguistics. This project aims to demonstrate this capability through various experiments utilizing network data from multiple contexts including company email, and messaging applications like Discord.
